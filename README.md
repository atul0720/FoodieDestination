```javascript
export default Component;
import Component from "path";
```

**Named Export/Import:**

## React Hooks

FoodieDestination utilizes React hooks for managing state and side effects:

1. `useState()`: Provides powerful state variable management in React.

2. `useEffect()`: Enables handling side effects in functional components.

## Routing

The application supports two types of routing:

1. **Client-Side Routing**: Allows for dynamic navigation within the application without a full page reload.

2. **Server-Side Routing**: Facilitates navigation by requesting new pages from the server.

## Redux Toolkit

To manage application state, FoodieDestination uses Redux Toolkit. The following steps outline its integration:

1. Install `@reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux`.

2. Build the Redux store.

3. Connect the store to the application.

4. Define slices (e.g., `cartSlice`) to manage specific parts of the state.

5. Dispatch actions to update the state.

6. Use selectors to access and retrieve data from the state.

## Testing

Developers can perform various types of testing in FoodieDestination:

1. **Unit Testing**: Isolates and tests individual units of code.

2. **Integration Testing**: Ensures that different parts of the application work together seamlessly.

3. **End-to-End Testing (E2E)**: Tests the application's functionality as a whole.

To set up testing in the application:

1. Install `React Testing Library`.

2. Install `jest`.

3. Install Babel dependencies and configure Babel.

4. Configure the Parcel config file to disable default Babel transpilation.

5. Set up Jest by running `npx jest --init`.

6. Install `jsdom` library for browser-like testing.

7. Include `@babel/preset-react` inside the Babel configuration for JSX support.

8. Install `@testing-library/jest-dom` for additional testing utilities.
